In this exercise, we implemented a basic ray tracer. 
We shot rays from the observer's eye (the camera) through a screen and into a scene that contained one or more surfaces.
We calculated the rays' intersections with the surfaces, found the nearest intersection, and calculated the color of the surface according to its material and lighting conditions.
We were required to implement a ray tracer with the following features.
